 # 0x02. Session Authentication

## Overview

This directory contains resources and code examples related to session authentication. Session authentication is a common method used to maintain user state and ensure secure access to web applications. It involves creating and managing sessions to track user activity across multiple requests.

## Contents

- `session_auth.py`: Implementation of session-based authentication in Python, demonstrating how to create, store, and validate user sessions.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the directory's contents and purpose.
- `examples/`: A folder containing example scripts and use cases showcasing session authentication in different scenarios.
- `tests/`: A folder with test cases and scripts to validate the functionality and security of session management implementations.

## Key Concepts
- Session Creation: How to generate and initialize user sessions.
- Session Storage: Methods for securely storing session data (e.g., in-memory, database, or cookies).
- Session Validation: Techniques for verifying active sessions and user authentication status.
- Session Expiration: Strategies for managing session timeouts and expirations to enhance security.
